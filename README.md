# ImageDownder

This is an online repository for an optional coding homework in Autum, 2020.

### Thanks

This project shall thank <https://github.com/nagadomi/lbpcascade_animeface> which provides sooo many ideas.

Also, Ryan Mitchell's Guid Book for Python Web Crawler aka 《Python网络爬虫权威指南（第2版）》helps with some codes.

#### Decription

  The Project is basically a Picture Download Application which Download Anime Pictures from konachan.net with a hand-written-Python-based Web Crawler and with the help of the animeFace project, the app is able to select and make Photos of faces from those pictures downloaded. Also, to satisfy the need of daily downloading, to see what's new up there, we did spare some efforts to modify few lines of codes - but all the way through the programme. However, we finally made it and a combination of those functions is now ready to work.

  So, here it is, The Final Version of the Python Based Picture Downloading and Photo Making Application.
